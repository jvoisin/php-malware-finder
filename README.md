Detect potentially malicious PHP files.
```

## What does it detect?

PHP-malware-finder does its very best to detect obfuscated/dodgy code as well as
files using PHP functions often used in malwares/webshells.

The following list of encoders/obfuscators/webshells are also detected:

* [Bantam](https://github.com/gellin/bantam)
* [Best PHP Obfuscator]( http://www.pipsomania.com/best_php_obfuscator.do )
* [Carbylamine]( https://code.google.com/p/carbylamine/ )
* [Cipher Design]( http://cipherdesign.co.uk/service/php-obfuscator )
* [Cyklodev]( http://sysadmin.cyklodev.com/online-php-obfuscator/ )
* [Joes Web Tools Obfuscator]( http://www.joeswebtools.com/security/php-obfuscator/ )
* [P.A.S]( http://profexer.name/pas/download.php )
* [PHP Jiami]( http://www.phpjiami.com/ )
* [Php Obfuscator Encode]( http://w3webtools.com/encode-php-online/ )
* [SpinObf]( http://mohssen.org/SpinObf.php )
* [Weevely3]( https://github.com/epinna/weevely3 )
* [atomiku]( http://atomiku.com/online-php-code-obfuscator/ )
* [cobra obfuscator]( http://obfuscator.uk/example/ )
* [nano]( https://github.com/UltimateHackers/nano )
* [novahot]( https://github.com/chrisallenlane/novahot )
* [phpencode]( http://phpencode.org )
* [tennc]( http://tennc.github.io/webshell/ )
* [web-malware-collection]( https://github.com/nikicat/web-malware-collection )
* [webtoolsvn]( http://www.webtoolsvn.com/en-decode/ )


Of course it's **trivial** to bypass PMF,
but its goal is to catch kiddies and idiots,
not people with a working brain.
If you report a stupid tailored bypass for PMF, you likely belong to one (or
both) category, and should re-read the previous statement.

## How does it work?

Detection is performed by crawling the filesystem and testing files against a
[set](https://github.com/jvoisin/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/php.yar)
of [YARA](http://virustotal.github.io/yara/) rules. Yes, it's that simple!

Instead of using a *hash-based* approach,
PMF tries as much as possible to use semantic patterns, to detect things like
"a `$_GET` variable is decoded two times, unzipped,
and then passed to some dangerous function like `system`".

## Installation
- Install Go (using your package manager, or [manually](https://go.dev/doc/install))
- Install libyara >= 4.2 (using your package manager, or [from source](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html))
- Download php-malware-finder: `git clone https://github.com/jvoisin/php-malware-finder.git`
- Build php-malware-finder: `cd php-malware-finder && make`

## How to use it?

```
$ ./phpmalwarefinder -h
Usage:
  phpmalwarefinder [OPTIONS] [Target]

Application Options:
  -r, --rules-dir=      Rules location (default: /etc/phpmalwarefinder or .)
  -a, --show-all        Display all matched rules
  -f, --fast            Enable YARA's fast mode'
  -R, --rate-limit=     Max. filesystem ops per second, 0 for no limit (default: 0)
  -v, --verbose         Verbose mode
  -w, --workers=        Number of workers to spawn for scanning (default: 32)
  -L, --long-lines      Check long lines
  -c, --exclude-common  Do not scan files with common extensions
  -i, --exclude-imgs    Do not scan image files
  -x, --exclude-ext=    Additional file extensions to exclude
  -u, --update          Update rules

Help Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message
```

Or if you prefer to use `yara`:

```
$ yara -r ./php.yar /var/www
```

Please keep in mind that you should use at least YARA 3.4 because we're using
[hashes]( https://yara.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/hash.html ) for the
whitelist system, and greedy regexps. Please note that if you plan to build
yara from sources, libssl-dev must be installed on your system in order to
have support for hashes.

Oh, and by the way, you can run the *comprehensive* testsuite with `make tests`.

## Whitelisting

Check the [whitelist.yar](https://github.com/jvoisin/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/whitelist.yar) file.
If you're lazy, you can generate whitelists for entire folders with the
[generate_whitelist.py](https://github.com/jvoisin/php-malware-finder/blob/master/php-malware-finder/utils/generate_whitelist.py) script.

## Why should I use it instead of something else?

Because:
- It doesn't use [a single rule per sample](
  https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/e264d66a8ea3be93db8482ab3d639a2ed3e9c949/yara/thor-webshells.yar
  ), since it only cares about finding malicious patterns, not specific webshells
- It has a [complete testsuite](https://travis-ci.org/jvoisin/php-malware-finder), to avoid regressions
- Its whitelist system doesn't rely on filenames
- It doesn't rely on (slow) [entropy computation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) )
- It uses a ghetto-style static analysis, instead of relying on file hashes
- Thanks to the aforementioned pseudo-static analysis, it works (especially) well on obfuscated files
